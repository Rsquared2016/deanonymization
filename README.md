## Description <span id="desc"></span>
Social network de-anonymization (provided with an anonymized graph and a crawled graph)

## Skeleton <span id="sklt"></span>
The process is divided into two parts: firstly generate a similarity matrix for node pairs acrossing two graphs, 
and then use specific methods to match them into answer pairs.

## Performance <span id="pfmc"></span>
Our algorithm has a satisfying performance with considerable improvement compared with baseline algorithm.
